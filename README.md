# Alumni-Tracking-System
It's a web portal which provides personalized access, based on an assigned or assumed user role.
Its integration capabilities allow universities to unite systems and user data on the back end.
An emphasis on consistency across digital touchpoints gives these united systems a shared look and feel on the front end.
Personalization through a combination of biographical data (who they are) and behavioral data (what they did on the site) gives the directorate the ability to contextualize experiences facilitated by a login process.
